<h1 align="center">Tron Idol</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
    Blockchain technology involves many abstract concepts that are difficult for people to understand. Therefore, our team abstracts the characteristics of various cryptocurrencies from the blockchain technology, creates anthropomorphic two-dimensional idols, in order to spread blockchain technology and contribute to the development of the industry.
</p>
<p>
    "Tron Idol" is an AI+ blockchain game based on our IP of “Link Idol. On the one hand, we hope to create more anime idols that are loved by users; on the other hand, we also encourage anime fans to join us in the ecology to create their own. In order to maintain high quality output, we use the Generating Against Network (GAN) algorithm, using AI to help us efficiently train and create new anime idols; in order to protect our original works and protect fans' creations, we launched a The AI+ blockchain game "Tron Idol", which can be regard as an exploration and attempt of distributed copyright on blockchain.
</p>
<h2>Project Background</h2>
<h3 align="center">Link Idol Project</h3>
<p>
    The Link Idols are anime virtual idols of Andromeda Technology, which aims to accelerate the popularity of blockchain knowledge in the younger generation. The young generation lives based on the Internet, they love innovation and love to explore. Since the blockchain technology is kind of difficult to understand, we use the anthropomorphic image to lower the barriers for young people to understanding the blockchain.
</p>
<p>
    Based on our own understanding of blockchain knowledge, we analysis and set the character of each cryptocurrency, create a virtual world view, and give these cryptocurrency idols a soul. They are not only abstract cryptocurrencies, but have thoughts, have stories, they are link idols with connotation .
</p>
<p>
    At present, the items that have been circulated in Link Idol include albums, character setting sets, calendars, stickers, and peripheral pendants, etc. It is the first time we put these characters into encryption collection on the blockchain and explore distributed copyright, that’s how Tron Idol born.
</p>

<h3 align="center">AI+ blockchain attemption</h3>
<p>The hand-painted works by the artist are always exhaustive. We can't rely on hand-painting to continuously and efficiently output your favorite idols, so why not let everyone create them together? In order to lower the barrier and enable everyone can participate in the generation of beautiful idols, we try to use the GAN algorithm to train the data. AI can help us train and synthesize the new anime idols, so that each Tron Idol is unique.
</p>
<p>In addition, the original characters of "Link Idol" and the new idols created by the users, will also be made into an encrypted collection on the Tron block blockchain, as a demostration of reshaping copyright management with token economy, which will promote the development of distributed copyright.
</p>
<p>In the future, we will try to work with other games based on these Tron Idol. Imagine playing other games with your own Tron idol, isn’t it cool? Even, you can give them content, write stories, create songs, and output articles for them – that’s how you create your own idol.
